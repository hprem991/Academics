PURPOSE:
  To Design the Visitor Pattern for retrieval of information from an input file using a BST.	

PERCENT COMPLETE:
  100%

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:
  0%

BUGS:
  None


JUSTIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURE:
  We decided to use a Binary Search Tree as that outperformed the other trees(AVL and Trie) 
  we implemented. The difference in performance was almost two times better than the others.
  An implementation of Trie would have been ideal if the performance test did not include 
  populating the tree.

FILES:
  build.xml
  Driver.java, The main driver program   BST.java, the Binary Search Tree object
  Node.java, the nodes associated with the Binary Search Tree
  FileProcessor.java, input/output file processing
  Logger.java, logger for debugging
  grepVisitor.java, visitor that outputs the number of times a word appears
  PopulateTreeVisitor.java, visitor that populates the tree
  TreeProcessingVisitorI.java, interface for the visitors
  WordCountVisitor.java, visitor that outputs the different counts needed for output
  README, the text file you are presently reading


TO COMPILE:
  ant compile_all
	
TO RUN:
  ant run -Darg0=<input file path name> -Darg1=<output file name> -Darg2=<number of iterations> -Darg3=<search word>
