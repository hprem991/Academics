Hi,

   Please read the following Readme as it contains important information.

   The folder structure contains malloc.c, malloc.h(you can remove it), my_test.c, utilities.c, utilities.h, Makefile and README.txt only.
   
   malloc.c contains the whole implememtation of the assignment (* Please read below)

   malloc.h contains the signature from the assignment.

   Makefile contains the invoking command for compilation.

   my_test.c contains testcase which are limited in numbers

   
	NOTE :- * Due to certain issue, I couldn't use the provided test.c file and have to rely on my own set of cases. Also please have a look at them from the my_test.c files.

		 I would also request you kind consideration as many of my implementation, I had to comment just before submission.I am deepy moved as I didn't had backup's of my implementation and suddenly all my addressing was generating error just before submission. Request you to please provide partial consideration and look for the logic as it was working till I messed up somewhere during realloc redesigning.  
		
		All addressing calculation  and merge functionality has been disabled (yet provided as commented code), due to segmentation fault generated at last hours of submission, Please test cases which does not use addressing calculation as it wonâ€™t support now and only one BST is supported for size consideration and not address consideration.


COMPILE :- 
 
	Please issue make command from the terminal
	
EXECUTE :-
	
	Please type ./a.out from the terminals
